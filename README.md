# 353-final-project

## Project topic: Sensors, Noise, and Walking

## Data
The data is divided into 2 directories:
- 1minData consists of several short time period samples on which we analyze walking paces
- 1kmData consists of longer data sets which we perform numerical integration on to determine how accurately the sensor measured our distance travelled

## How to run the project
- The libraries you will need include numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy, sklearn, and seaborn (if generating plots).
- The scripts can be run with `python3 <filename>`.
- Be sure to keep directory and file structure the same as the processing scripts rely on it

There are three python scripts you can execute:
- walkPaceProcessing.py will process the smaller data sets and generate plots if they are uncommented
- integrationProcessing.py will process the larger data sets, print the total distances travelled and generate plots if they are uncommented
- machineLearning.py will run the training models and some statistical tests on the subject_walk_pace_results.csv file that is generated by walkPaceProcessing.py

plotting.py is a file that simply contains all of the plotting functions

### You should run the scripts in the following order:
1. `walkPaceProcessing.py`
2. `integrationProcessing.py`
3. `machineLearning.py`
## Note on plotting
If you want to generate all of the plots please uncomment the following lines:
- in integrationProcessing.py -> 47,48,52,53
- in walkPaceProcessing.py -> 52
